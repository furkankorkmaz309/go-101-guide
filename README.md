# Go 101 Guide: Personal Learning Notes for the Go Programming Language

🧠 **This repository contains personal notes and code examples I wrote while studying _Learning Go (2nd Edition)_ by Jon Bodner (O'Reilly Media).**

The goal of this project is to solidify my understanding of Go's core concepts through simple, focused code and practical explanations — and to create a reference I can come back to later.

Each topic includes:
- 🧪 A concise Go code example (`01_example.go`)
- 📝 Complementary notes explaining the key concepts (`02_notes.md`)

## 📚 Topics Covered

This guide walks through the following topics:

- ⚙️ Setting up Go & Hello World  
- 🧱 Basic Syntax and Structure  
- 📦 Variables and Data Types  
- 🔁 Control Structures (`if`, `switch`, loops)  
- 🧩 Functions  
- 📌 Pointers  
- 🚨 Error Handling  
- 🧑‍💻 Structs and Interfaces  
- 🧬 Generics

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/furkankorkmaz309/go-101-guide.git
    cd go-101-guide
    ```

2. Run any Go file directly:

## 🤔 Why This Exists
- 👓 Reading and modifying small, self-contained code examples  
- ✍️ Writing their own notes along the way  
- 🔁 Revisiting fundamental topics whenever needed
